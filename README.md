# XDATCAR_extractor

The XDATCAR Extractor is a Python module that analyses XDATCAR files to calculate the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD), diffusivity, and conductivity for a given chemical species. It makes use of the pymatgen library to handle the necessary computations.

Note: This code is not robust and is only intended for use within the author's directory architecture. A couple of examples of situations where this will work are given below:

temperature_1000 / run_{i} / XDATCAR  
800K / run_{j} / XDATCAR   

Variability in the number of runs per temperature is permitted, i.e. where i â‰  j. It should also be noted where i or j = 0 the directory will be ignored. 

Currently all runs must have the following form run_{i} --> This will likely be changed when I get chance. 

## Installation

Clone the repo and install:
```
git clone https://github.com/fforrester/XDATCAR_extractor.git
cd XDATCAR_extractor
pip install .
```
### Alternatively
```
pip install git+https://github.com/fforrester/XDATCAR_extractor.git
```

## Implementation 

Ensure that your runs have the required directory structure, including directories with numeric temperatures as a part of their names, e.g., 300K, 600, T900, 1000_K, Li3PS4_1200K, etc.

Run the XDATCAR_extractor with the following command:
```
XDATCAR_extractor <species> [--outfile <output_filename>] [--time_step <time_step>] [--ballistic_skip <ballistic_skip>] [--step_skip <step_skip>] [--smoothed <smoothing_type>] [--temperatures <temperature_list>]
```

* species : The chemical species you want to analyse, e.g., "Li", "Na", "O", etc.
* --outfile <output_filename>: (Optional) Specify the output filename. Default is "AIMD_extractor.log".
* --time_step <time_step>: (Optional) Time step in femtoseconds (fs). Default is 2 fs.
* --ballistic_skip <ballistic_skip>: (Optional) Number of steps to skip to avoid the ballistic region. Default is 50.
* --step_skip <step_skip>: (Optional) Number of steps to skip for efficiency. Default is 1.
* --smoothed <smoothing_type>: (Optional) Turning smoothing on or off with True opr False, respectively. Default True
* --temperatures <temperature_list>: (Optional) Specify a list of temperatures in Kelvin. If not provided, the script will attempt to locate temperature directories based on the regular expression in the directory names.

## Example Usage

* Analysing AIMD runs for species "Li" at temperatures 300K and 600K:
```XDATCAR_extractor Li --temperatures 300 600```
* Analysing AIMD runs for species "Na" with a custom output filename:
```XDATCAR_extractor Na --outfile analysis_results.log```
* Analyzing XDATACR for species "O" with a 1 fs time step:
```XDATCAR_extractor O --time_step 1```
